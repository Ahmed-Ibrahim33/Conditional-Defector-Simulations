# Conditional Defector Simulations

This repository contains NetLogo simulations based on the paper "The conditional defector strategies can violate the most crucial supporting mechanisms of cooperation" (Scientific Reports, 2022). The models explore evolution of cooperation, conditional defection, and mechanisms like kin selection, spatial structure, and punishment.

## Models
- **Evolution_of_sustainability_through_monitoring_and_punishment.nlogo**: Focuses on monitoring and punishment in resource management.
- **Evolution_and_patchy_resources.nlogo**: Simulates evolution in patchy resource environments.
- **group_dispersal.nlogo**: Models group dispersal and conditional defection.

## How to Run
1. Download and install [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (version 6.1.1 or later).
2. Open any .nlogo file in NetLogo.
3. Click "Setup" then "Go" to run the simulation.
4. Adjust sliders for parameters like `Percent-Sustainables`, `Mutation-rate`, etc.
