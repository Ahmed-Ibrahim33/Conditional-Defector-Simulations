# Conditional Defector Simulations

This repository contains Python and NetLogo simulations based on the paper "The conditional defector strategies can violate the most crucial supporting mechanisms of cooperation" (Scientific Reports, 2022). The models explore the evolution of cooperation, conditional defection, and mechanisms like kin selection, group selection, spatial structure, and punishment.

## Models
- **Evolution_and_patchy_resources.nlogo**: Simulates evolution in patchy resource environments.
- **Evolution_of_sustainability_through_monitoring_and_punishment.nlogo**: Focuses on monitoring and punishment in resource management.
- **Conditional Defection (cooperate for the spread)_group_dispersal.nlogo**: Models group dispersal and conditional defection.
- **Conditional Defection in the Commons Pay to escape**: It is an updated NetLogo implementation of the second model described in the article.
- **Python NetLogo-like model group dispersal Matplotlib Animation**: This model is an enhanced Python-based implementation of the first model described in the article.

## How to Run
1. Download and install [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (version 6.1.1 or later).
2. Open any .nlogo file in NetLogo.
3. Click "Setup" then "Go" to run the simulation.
4. Adjust sliders for parameters like `Percent-Sustainables`, `Mutation-rate`, etc.
